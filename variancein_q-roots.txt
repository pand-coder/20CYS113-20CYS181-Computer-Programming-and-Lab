Find ing the roots of a quadratic equation in various methods with learning of precedence 


Method 1.) In this method we can see that a variable named delta is reserved for the b^2-4ac it is useful in describing the brackets were there would be no presence of complexity.

Quadratic Equation took for checking is x^2-11x+28=0 where the roots are 7,4 

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
void main()
{
double a,b,c,delta,x1,x2;
printf("Enter the value of a :");
scanf("%lf",&a);
printf("Enter the value of b : ");
scanf("%lf",&b);
printf("Enter the value of c : ");
scanf("%lf",&c);
delta = b*b - 4*a*c;
x1 = (-b+sqrt(delta))/2*a;
x2 = (-b-sqrt(delta))/2*a;
printf("The quadratic root of equation of x1 is %lf",x1);
printf("\n The quadratic root of equation of x2 is %lf",x2);
}

output attained : The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 7.000000
                  The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 4.000000

We have got the correct output 

Method 2.) Including math.h library by using pow() function

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
void main ()
{
int a,b,c,x1,x2;
printf("Enter the coefficient of x^2 : ");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("Enter the coefficient of x : ");
scanf("%d",&b);
printf("Enter the value of constant (c) : ");
scanf("%d",&c);
x1 = (-b+sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c))/(2*a);
x2 = (-b-sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c))/(2*a);
printf("The quadratic root of equation of x1 is %d",x1);
printf("\n The quadratic root of equation of x2 is %d",x2);
}

output attained : The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 7
                  The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 4

We have got the correct output 

Method 3.) In this method by using normal asterisk for inner product of sqrt()

#include<stdio.h>
#include<math.h>
void main()
{
int a,b,c,x1,x2;
printf("Enter the value of a :");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("Enter the value of b : ");
scanf("%d",&b);
printf("Enter the value of c : ");
scanf("%d",&c);
x1 = (-b+sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a);
x2 = (-b-sqrt(b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a);
printf("The quadratic root of equation of x1 is %d",x1);
printf("\n The quadratic root of equation of x2 is %d",x2);
}

We have got the correct output 

Method 4.) Using Float datatype 


float a,b,c,x1,x2;
x1 = (-b+sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c))/(2*a);
x2 = (-b-sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c))/(2*a);

output attained : The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 7.000000
                  The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 4.000000

 We have got the correct output 


These are the ways which i had thinkoff to do correctly. 

Let's Explore the concept of precedence concept by changing the abovr program

case 1 : let's remove some paranthesis in x and x2 near 2*a

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
void main ()
{
int a,b,c,x1,x2;
printf("Enter the coefficient of x^2 : ");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("Enter the coefficient of x : ");
scanf("%d",&b);
printf("Enter the value of constant (c) : ");
scanf("%d",&c);
x1 = -b+sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;
x2 = -b-sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;
printf("The quadratic root of equation of x1 is %d",x1);
printf("\n The quadratic root of equation of x2 is %d",x2);
}

output attained : The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 7
                  The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 4


We have got the correct output 

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<math.h>
void main ()
{
int a,b,c,x1,x2;
printf("Enter the coefficient of x^2 : ");
scanf("%d",&a);
printf("Enter the coefficient of x : ");
scanf("%d",&b);
printf("Enter the value of constant (c) : ");
scanf("%d",&c);
x1 = -b+sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;
x2 = -b-sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;
printf("The quadratic root of equation of x1 is %d",x1);
printf("\n The quadratic root of equation of x2 is %d",x2);
}

output attained : The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 7
                  The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 4

x1 = -b+sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/(2*a);
x2 = -b-sqrt(pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/(2*a);

The quadratic root of equation of x1 is 12.500000
 The quadratic root of equation of x2 is 9.500000

output attained is wrong


x1 = (-b+sqrt pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;
x2 = (-b-sqrt pow(b,2)-4*a*c)/2*a;

Attained compilation errors

x1 = -b+sqrt b*b-4*a*c/2*a;
x2 = -b-sqrt b*b-4*a*c/2*a;

Attained compilation errors
